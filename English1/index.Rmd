After the successful French R Meetings of ([Bordeaux](http://r2012.bordeaux.inria.fr/), [Lyon](https://r2013-lyon.sciencesconf.org/), [Montpellier](https://r2014-mtp.sciencesconf.org/), [Grenoble](https://r2015-grenoble.sciencesconf.org/) and [Toulouse](https://r2016-toulouse.sciencesconf.org/)), our sixth meeting will take place in Anglet at the ``Parc Montaury'' ([UFR Sciences et Techniques de la CÃ´te Basque](http://ufr-sciences-cb.univ-pau.fr/live/)) on 28-30 June 2017.  Its aim is to provide a national forum to exchange and share ideas on the use of R in different subjects such as visualisation, applied statistics, biostatistics and bioinformatics, Bayesian statistics, data analysis, Big Data, modelling, machine learning, high performance computing, etc. 

A series of tutorials on specific or advanced R topics will be proposed to the conference attendees in the afternoon of Wednesday, June 28.



## *Topics*
The programme will consist of plenary sessions, oral presentations, lightning talks and posters (see Submission page for more details) focusing on:

- new developments in statistics and their implementation in R
- new extensions
- original applications and case studies using R in different domains and fields (-omics, bioinformatics, environment, psychometrics, social science, chemometrics, etc.)
- Computational aspects of R (parallel processing, visualization, interfacing with other software, graphical user interface,etc.)
- teaching with  R.


This meeting is intended to everyone interested in R: Researchers, teachers, people from industries, students, etc... It is built for both beginners and advanced R users. Statisticians and informaticians are welcomed, as well as well-wishers from every area where R can be useful.

The official language is French but talks can be given in English.
